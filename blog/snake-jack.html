            <h1>Building a Snake Game in Jack: Working With a Minimalist OOP Language</h1>

            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>Today, I want to share my experience developing a classic Snake game using Jack, a simple object-oriented programming language 
                designed for educational purposes. This journey taught me valuable lessons about both game development and the constraints of working 
                with a minimalist programming language.</p>

                <h2>The Jack Language: Simple Yet Challenging</h2>
                <p>Jack is an interesting language that strips away many features taken for granted in modern languages. There's no inheritance, no 
                floating-point numbers, and even basic operators like != are missing. Instead of writing <code>if (x != y)</code>, you have to write 
                <code>if (~(x = y))</code>. These limitations forced me to think differently about how I structure my code.</p>

                <h2>Game Architecture</h2>
                <p>I divided the game into four main classes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Main</code>: The entry point</li>
                    <li><code>Game</code>: The game loop and core logic</li>
                    <li><code>Snake</code>: The snake's behavior and movement</li>
                    <li><code>Food</code>: Food spawning and positioning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most challenging part was managing the snake's movement. I represented the snake as an array of x,y coordinate pairs, where each 
                pair defines a segment's position. When the snake moves, each segment takes the position of the segment in front of it, and the head 
                moves in the current direction.</p>

                <h2>Memory Management Matters</h2>
                <p>One aspect of Jack that really made me appreciate modern languages is manual memory management. Every object you create must be 
                explicitly disposed of when you're done with it. My Game class's dispose method had to clean up both the snake and food objects:</p>
<pre><code>method void dispose() {
    do snake.dispose();
    do food.dispose();
    do Memory.deAlloc(this);
    return;
}</code></pre>

                <h2>Random Number Generation</h2>
                <p>Generating random positions for the food was tricky since Jack doesn't have a random number generator. I implemented a simple 
                pseudo-random number generator using the following algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>method void randomize() {
    let seed = seed + 20251;
    let seed = seed * 2377;
    let seed = seed / 7;
    // Use seed to calculate x,y positions
    return;
}</code></pre>

                <h2>Control Flow Quirks</h2>
                <p>The lack of else-if statements led to some deeply nested code. For example, handling keyboard input looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (key = 131) { // Up
    do snake.changeDirection(1);
} else {
    if (key = 133) { // Down
        do snake.changeDirection(2);
    } else {
        if (key = 130) { // Left
            do snake.changeDirection(3);
        } else {
            if (key = 132) { // Right
                do snake.changeDirection(4);
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p>Evidently not the most elegant of soulutions, but it got the job done.</p>

                <h2>Graphics and Screen Management</h2>
                <p>The game's visual elements are quite basic - the snake segments are rectangles, and the food is a circle. Jack's Screen class 
                provides basic drawing primitives, but you have to manage everything at the pixel level. The screen is 512x256 pixels, and you need 
                to be careful not to draw outside these boundaries.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Building this game taught me several valuable lessons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The importance of careful memory management</li>
                    <li>How to work within the constraints of a limited language</li>
                    <li>The value of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces</li>
                    <li>The fundamentals of game loop implementation</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Most importantly, it gave me a deeper appreciation for the conveniences we have in modern programming languages. Every feature we 
                take for granted today - garbage collection, rich standard libraries, complex control structures - exists because someone once had to 
                program without it and said "there must be a better way."</p>
